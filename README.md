# checkers

This app is a traditional game of checkers. 

To play run `npm install`  then `npm start` in the project folder

Pieces can move diagonally in their designated direction 

Once a piece is "Kinged" it is free to move in any direction

If there is a jump(overtake) opportunity available, the player or the AI will be forced to take that move.

Hovering a piece will highlight any potential moves you can make

Wins and game time are tracked at the top of the screen. Time will be reset when a new game is started but wins will remain
